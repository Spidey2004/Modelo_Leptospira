# Modelo Leptospira
A Machine Learning Framework for Serogroup Classification of pathogenic species of Leptospira Based on rfb Locus Profiles
The application is designed to run directly in a Jupyter Notebook hosted on **Google Colab**.

## How it works
- The main workflow is implemented in a Colab notebook (`hierarchical_classifier_colab.ipynb`).
    - in the link https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PPU1BBlZMfFZnpr1beYSUjlNvePoTSSc?usp=sharing
- Users can open the notebook in Google Colab and execute the cells step by step.
- No local installation is required; everything runs in the cloud.

## Requirements
- A Google account to access Google Colab.

## Usage
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run the cells in order to reproduce the analysis and results.
3. Modify the code or parameters as needed for your own experiments.
